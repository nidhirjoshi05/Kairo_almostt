To integrate a single new webpage into our existing website. This page will host two psychological assessments: the PANAS Questionnaire and the Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS-HPD). The page must include aesthetic descriptions of each test and implement a freemium model.
Freemium Model Logic:
All users (Freemium & Pro) can take both tests.
PANAS Test: Results are free and shown to all users.
EIS-HPD (EQ Test): Results are gated.
Freemium users will see an "Upgrade to Pro" call-to-action instead of their results.
Pro users will see their full, detailed, graphical results.
1. Key Integration & Styling Requirements
Styling & Branding: The new page must seamlessly match the existing website's visual identity. This includes using the existing CSS stylesheets, fonts, color palette, button styles, layout, and a mobile-responsive design.
Header/Footer: The new page must use the website's existing global header and footer.
Navigation: Please add the entry point for this new feature on in the navigation bar, and name it Assessments
URL Structure: Please create the new page at the following URL: [your-website-url.com]/assessments (or suggest a more logical path for our existing site).
2. New Page Layout (.../assessments)
This single page should be designed in a clean, aesthetic way, with two distinct sections or "cards," one for each test. Each section will contain:
A description of the test.
The full questionnaire.
Section 1: PANAS Questionnaire (Freemium)
Aesthetic Description:
Title: Check Your Current Mood: The PANAS Scale
Text: How are you feeling, right now? The PANAS Questionnaire is a widely used 20-item scale that measures your current emotional state1. It provides a score for Positive Affect (the extent to which you feel enthusiastic, active, and alert) and Negative Affect (the extent to which you feel aversive states like distress, anger, or fear)22. Take this quick test to get an instant snapshot of your present-moment feelings3.
Test Interface:
Instructions: "Indicate to what extent you feel this way right now (at the present moment), using the scale below." 4
Rating Scale: 5-point radio buttons: 1 - Very Slightly or Not at All, 2 - A Little, 3 - Moderately, 4 - Quite a Bit, 5 - Extremely 5.
Test Items: The 20 PANAS items (Interested, Distressed, Excited, etc.)6.
Section 2: Emotional Intelligence Scale (Premium)
Aesthetic Description:
Title: Discover Your Emotional Intelligence: The EIS-HPD Scale
Text: Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, and to recognize and influence the emotions of others. This 34-item assessment 7measures your overall Emotional Intelligence and breaks it down into 10 key factors, including Self-Awareness, Empathy, Self-Motivation, and Managing Relations8888. Understand your strengths and opportunities for growth.
(Note: Results for this test are a Pro feature.)
Test Interface:
Instructions: "Here some statements are given and for every statement you have to express your views by making a tick on any one cell of the five alternatives." 9
Rating Scale: 5-point radio buttons: Strongly Agree, Agree, Uncertain, Disagree, Strongly Disagree10.
Test Items: The 34 EIS-HPD items (I can encourage others..., People tell me I am an inspiration..., etc.) 11.
3. Submission & Conditional Results Logic
Place a single "Submit & See Results" button at the bottom of the page.
On submission, the page should process both tests and display the results dynamically on the same page(e.g., in accordions, modals, or new content blocks that appear), based on the user's plan.
A. PANAS Results (Always Shown)
This section should always appear for all users (Freemium and Pro).
Display: Show the two scores clearly.
Positive Affect Score: [User's PA Score] (out of 50)
Negative Affect Score: [User's NA Score] (out of 50)
Visuals: Include the graphical gauges/bars as specified in the Appendix.
Interpretation: Include the interpretation text (see Appendix).
B. EIS-HPD (EQ Test) Results (Conditional)
This is the key logic. The backend must check the user's subscription status.
IF User is on a "Free" / "Freemium" plan:
DO NOT show the results.
Instead, display an Upgrade Call-to-Action (CTA) block.
Example Copy: "### You've completed the Emotional Intelligence test!
To unlock your detailed results, including your overall EQ score, a 10-factor breakdown, and a personalized radar chart, please upgrade to our Pro plan."
Include a prominent "Upgrade Now" button that links to our pricing/upgrade page.
IF User is on a "Pro" / "Premium" plan:
DO show the full, detailed results.
Display: Show the "Overall Emotional Intelligence" score and interpretation (High/Normal/Low).
Visuals: Include the "Overall Score" gauge, the Radar Chart for the 10 factors, and the detailed factor table (all specified in the Appendix).
