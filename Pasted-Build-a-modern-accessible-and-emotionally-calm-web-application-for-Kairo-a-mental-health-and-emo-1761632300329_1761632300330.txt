Build a modern, accessible, and emotionally calm web application for Kairo — a mental health and emotional wellness platform with Freemium and Pro plans, themed around trust, care, and psychological wellbeing.

Design Language & Style:

Use React + TypeScript + Vite (as per my current files).

TailwindCSS for all styling and utility classes.

Framer Motion for subtle transitions and animations.

Maintain the existing Kairo color scheme from my CSS:

Primary #3674B5

Secondary #578FCA

Accent #A1E3F9

Light #D1F8EF

Background #FFFFFF, Foreground #1A1A1A

Soft gradients: from-blue-600 via-purple-600 to-pink-600 for highlights.

Layout tone: gentle gradients, rounded corners, soft shadows, calm visuals suitable for therapy and wellness.

Must stay consistent with my existing component files (MainApp, PremiumApp, PeerGroup, TherapistMatching, etc.).

Page Flow:

1️⃣ Landing Page (Home)

Clean hero section with the Kairo logo and tagline:
“Find Calm, Anytime, Anywhere”
Subtitle: “Your personal companion for emotional wellness and mental health support.”

“Begin Your Journey” button centered below the tagline.

Background: smooth gradient using #3674B5 → #A1E3F9 → #D1F8EF.

Animation: soft fade-in for hero text.

Button action → routes to the dual-option page.

2️⃣ Dual-Option Page (After clicking “Begin Your Journey”)

Split screen layout:
Left panel:

Text: “Regular consultations with experts of your choice.”

Subtext: short supportive line (e.g. “Professional help, scheduled your way.”)

“Get Started” button → routes to Pro Plan (PremiumApp).

Optional illustration of therapist sessions (two people in video call).

Right panel:

Text: “Free All-India Emergency Mental Health Helpline.”

Subtext: “Immediate help for anyone in need.”

“Get Started” button → routes to Free Plan (MainApp).

Illustration of a smiling counselor on laptop.

Use soft beige-pink and light-blue gradient backgrounds to divide both sides.

Keep it responsive and accessible (mobile-first, collapses into stacked layout).

Functional Requirements:

Free Plan (MainApp)

Implements:

One-time EQ self-assessment + summary.

Basic journaling with simple prompts.

Technical Details:

Use React Router to manage page transitions (/, /get-started, /free, /pro).

Use localStorage for temporary persistence of plan state and user data (EQ results, journal entries, peer group history).

Import existing components where applicable:

Navbar, KairoLogo, PeerGroup, PremiumPeerGroup, ProfessionalCare, Profile, TherapistMatching, WhatsAppHelpline.

Implement a PlanContext (global state) to determine if user is on Free or Pro.

Animate transitions between pages with Framer Motion (opacity, y transitions).

Deliverables:

Full React + Vite project structure.

Pages:

/ – Landing

/get-started – Dual option page

/free – MainApp (Freemium features)

/pro – PremiumApp (Pro features)

Maintain consistent branding, colors, typography, and UX tone.

All buttons functional (navigate or toggle plan context).

Responsive and visually consistent across 768px–1518px resolutions.

Tone & Experience:
Kairo should feel like a digital sanctuary — calm gradients, empathetic microcopy, and intuitive navigation. The user should feel they’re stepping into a safe, intelligent, and compassionate environment.
